                Gran Turismo Sport is a racing video game developed by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. It was released on October 17, 2017 in North America, October 18, 2017 in Europe, and October 19, 2017 in Japan,
                and is the 13th game in the Gran Turismo series, the seventh game in the main series, and the first game in the series to be released for the PlayStation 4. One of Gran Turismo Sport's main focuses is competitive online racing, supported by
                the international governing body of motorsport, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and serving as the platform for the FIA- Certified Gran Turismo Championships.[1] The game launched with 168 cars and 29 tracks, but free
                game updates have brought the count to 324 cars and 82 track configurations as of December 2019. The free updates also added a more traditional single-player campaign mode to the game.

                Similar to its predecessors, Gran Turismo Sport is a racing game and includes two game modes: "Sport Mode" and "Arcade Mode". Online racing is also featured in the game. The game has been described as different from the "Prologue" titles seen in the past
                in the series and features more content. Unlike Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6, the game does not feature a dynamic weather system or day-night cycle. However, players still have the option to modify the race's time of day before entering
                the race. It includes 327 cars and 82 configurations in 32 locations to race on as of December 2019. For the first time in the series, the game features Porsche vehicles included in the game after Electronic Arts' licensing rights to the Porsche
                brand had expired (previous Gran Turismo games only included Ruf as a substitute). lthough Gran Turismo has an arcade mode, most gameplay derives from its simulation mode. Players start with a certain number of credits, usually 10,000, which
                are used to purchase vehicles from several manufacturer-specific shops, or (more likely at the beginning) from used car dealers, and then tune their car at the appropriate parts store for best performance. Certain events are open only to particular
                types of vehicles. In order to enter and progress through more difficult races, a license-testing system has been implemented, which guides players through skill development. Players may apply prize money won in events to upgrade their existing
                car or buy a new one, collecting a garage of vehicles. Since Gran Turismo 5 Prologue launched on the PS3, an online aspect of the gameplay has started to evolve. GT5 Prologue has enabled users to race online with up to 16 players on track
                at once. Gran Turismo 4 for the PS2 was actually the first online-enabled Gran Turismo game but the online aspect of the game did not make it past beta stage.

                Gran Turismo Sport also features two championships held simultaneously throughout the year: the Nations Cup, in which players represent their country, and the Manufacturers Cup, in which players represent their favorite car manufacturer. The FIA manages
                the series directly as they would with any of their other race series. The winners of the championships are honored at the FIA's annual prize-giving ceremony in Paris. The winner of the inaugural FIA GT Sport Nations Cup in 2018 was Americas
                regional champion Igor Fraga (Brazil, IOF_RACING17). European regional champion Mikail Hizal (Germany, TRL_LIGHTNING) finished 2nd, while Asia-Oceania regional finalist Cody Latkovski (Australia, Nik_Makozi) ended in 3rd. The year's Manufacturers
                Cup was won by Lexus, represented by their top drivers Tyrell Meadows (USA, GT_Academy2013), Vincent Rigaud (France, Oscaro_SkyPikmin), and Kanata Kawakami (Japan, Kawakana222), while Toyota (Agustín Cajal (Argentina, ORMA_Aspicito), Rayan
                Derrouchie (France, RC_Miura) and Tomoaki Yamanaka (Japan, YamadoRacing38)) and Aston Martin (Jonathan Bucha (USA, hendrix323), Thomas Compton-Mcpherson (Great Britain, cubertom) and Yoshiharu Imai (Japan, legacy0193)) took 2nd and 3rd respectively.
                The live streams of the World Finals in Monaco exceeded a total of 3 million viewers across the various channels.

                Gran Turismo (Italian/Spanish for "grand tourer" or "grand touring"), abbreviated GT, is a series of racing simulation video games developed by Polyphony Digital. Developed for PlayStation systems, Gran Turismo games are intended to emulate the appearance
                and performance of a large selection of vehicles, nearly all of which are licensed reproductions of real-world automobiles. Since the franchise's debut in 1997, over 85 million units have been sold worldwide for the PlayStation, PlayStation
                2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Portable, making it the highest selling video game franchise under the PlayStation brand. The Gran Turismo series is developed by Polyphony Digital and produced by Kazunori Yamauchi. Gran Turismo
                can trace back its origins to 1992, when Kazunori Yamauchi set out with a group of seven to develop the original Gran Turismo, which took five years to complete.[4][5] The appeal of the Gran Turismo series is due significantly to its graphics,
                a large number of licensed vehicles, attention to vehicle detail, accurate driving physics emulation, and the ability to tune performance, hence the subtitle "The Real Driving Simulator", incorporated to the franchise's iconography since Gran
                Turismo 4. Handling of the vehicles is modeled on real-life driving impressions, tuning is based on principles of physics, and the sound of the vehicle's engine is based on recordings of the actual vehicles. The game has been a flagship for
                the PlayStation console's graphics capabilities, and is often used to demonstrate the system's potential.
